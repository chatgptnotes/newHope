	<h1>Story So Far</h1>

	<p>43 year old Dr BK Murali lives in the Medical hub of central
		india, Nagpur which caters to the medical needs of one million
		population. As a hospital owner and Orthopaedic surgeon he was
		confronted with a lack of proper tracking system to prevent HAI and
		reduce errors. A lack of a complete Hospital management system , lack
		of an electronic medical records system, that he could access from
		anywhere at any time. He was challenged to create a solution to the
		many issues and challenges faced by hospitals today and the healthcare
		industry in general. So initially he designed an application to assist
		in the micro management of a busy hospital environment, which would
		monitor the complete hospitals day to day management in his absence.</p>

		<p>This led to the creation of DrMSaaS. DrMSaaS went on to win national
		awards for the best innovation in healthcare technology and bringing a
		hospital management system which could be used from any location
		anytime, affordable and accessible. The response was overwhelming. But
		there was a need to also provide hospitals with a tracking and
		monitoring tool that could analyse the enormous amounts of data that
		was being collected in the hospitals but not analysed. The major
		reason being lack of technology and lack of funds. This resulted in
		unnecessary death caused by HAI which could not be tracked , large
		number of R & D which could not be performed, Hospitals were unable to
		contribute to Indian statistics to prevent HAI deaths, to prevent
		medical error and to improve quality of healthcare. This led to stage
		two of our development Get NABH. A SaaS application that incorporates
		the entire clinical and management performance indictors required for
		a hospital to conform to the improvement of quality care , reducing
		deaths, and reducing costs.</p>
