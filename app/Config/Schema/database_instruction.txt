DataBase Preparation 

1) Remove the facility table from database.
2) remove the facility_id from location table
3) Remove facility foreign key constraint fro location table
4) Remove facility_id from users table.


Data Base dumping file - 

1) Config\Schema\master.sql   - data and structure of master database.
2) Config\Schema\slave.sql    - Structure of slave dabase.



Creation of slave database

1) Whenever a hospital add system will create the database for it and take a details of it on it's database table "facility_database_mappings".
   app\Vendor\DrmhopeDB.php script does this operation.

Seeding data to the slave database

2) app\Vendor\SeedData.php script create the all tables for slave database using Config\Schema\slave.sql.


Import Data in to the slave database

1) app\Vendor\hope_data.sql contains all initial data which need to be in slave database. we can run app\Vendor\dump.php for importing the data.

I have made two script one is shell and another is batch file for running this dump.php as a backgroud process so that database importing will run in background.
