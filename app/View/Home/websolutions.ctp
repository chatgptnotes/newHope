			<p>DrMHope made it to the top 50 for India innovation Growth program.
				The India Innovation Growth Programme is a joint initiative of the
				Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India; Lockheed
				Martin Corporation; Indo-US Science and Technology Forum, Federation
				of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry; Stanford Graduate
				School of Business and the IC2 Institute at the University of Texas.
				The aim of this programme is to accelerate innovative Indian
				technologies into the global markets. The India Innovation Growth
				Program is the only program of its kind, because of its focus on
				teaching using world-class commercialization strategies and the
				business development assistance provided.</p>

			<p>The aim of this IIGP program is to accelerate innovative new
				Indian technologies into new markets in the United States and around
				the world. It's a highly selective program that's looking for the
				most innovative technologies that India has to offer. The India
				Innovation Growth Program is the only program of its kind, because
				of its focus on using world-class commercialization strategies.</p>

			<p>During the first phase of the programme, the project team
				comprising of subject matter experts from FICCI selected 100
				innovative technologies from a wide range of sectors such as
				aeronautics, agriculture, biotechnology, chemistry, communications,
				computing, defense, electronics, environment, healthcare,
				information technology, manufacturing, materials, life sciences,
				nanotechnology, petrochemical, semiconductors and transportation.</p>

			<p>FICCI approved applications and technologies were refined and
				ranked through an interactive idea management social media tool. A
				joint team comprising all program partners evaluated and scored all
				the shortlisted applications received to select the most appropriate
				technology companies to go forward in the programme on the basis of
				several predefined parameters (such as development status, patent
				status, funding required to technology development, etc.). The
				assessments are done in two phases. During the first phase,
				applicants use the online tool and a proposal guide created by
				program partners to refine their submissions. In the second phase,
				evaluators reviewed and offered constructive feedback on the
				technical and commercialization potential of submissions. Using
				score data and comments, the online technical community of experts
				ranked the applications and selected the top 50. All 100 innovators
				receive reports generated from the expert evaluators' feedback with
				the top 50 received additional comments for further idea improvement
				and development.</p>


			<p>DrMHope was one of the Top 50 innovations from across the country
				that was shortlisted.</p>

			<p>DrMHope is an innovative way to create quality based Hospital
				Business Systems. This SaaS based hospital information system is
				based on open source trusted technology. It is designed to integrate
				the different information systems into one single efficient system.
				It solves the problems inherent in a network of multiple programs
				that are not compatible. It can integrate almost any type of
				services, systems, departments, clinic, processes, data,
				communication, etc. that exist in a hospital. It can even handle
				non- medical services or functions like security, maintenance, etc.
				It is modular and highly scalable. There is no need for special user
				interface software. All program modules are processed on the server
				side. Module updates and extensions do not require changes on the
				browsers thus there are no network interruptions and downtimes. Even
				if hospital is located in remote areas with poor internet
				connectivity, works offline and syncs later. It reduces medical
				errors and improves quality of care. It provides a solution at
				1/10th of the cost of legacy software.</p>

			<p class="highlight"><i>"The value of this program is in its competitiveness, and also in
				its opportunity to bring different expertise into one program: We
				have FICCI, we have IC<sup>2</sup> Institute, we have the Indo-US Science and
				Technology Forum, we have Lockheed Martin, and we have the
				Department of Science and Technology. They all operate in different
				spaces in their businesses, but in the India Innovation Growth
				program they are focused on nourishing the innovators and increasing
				the quality of this innovation process.The program will transform
				the way the world looks at an innovation"</i></p>
