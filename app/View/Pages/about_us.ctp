<p>Led by <b>Dr BK Murali</b> and <b> Caroline Ruby Ammon</b>,owners of both <b>Hope Hospitals</b> , Nagpur and DrMHope Softwares Pvt Ltd. </p>
 
<p>Soon after <b>Dr Murali</b> started <b>Hope hospital</b>, he realised that playing dual role - that of a practicing surgeon, and managing his hospital set-up would be tough; and could come in the way of achieving his vision of providing timely treatment & best patient care at low cost.</p>
  
<p>And thus began his search for asolution; a system which would stream line & integrate various activities of hospital(clinical, back office, generic management etc) without requiring his personal involvement at every step.
</p>
<p>He consistently faced challenges arising from lack of a system totrack, monitor & analyse enormous data collected at the hospital;lack of proper records tosupport clinical decision-making; lack of electronically integrated medical records accessible from anywhere, any time; systems to improve patient care; reduce HAI etc. </p>
<p>Deaths caused by HAI couldn`t be tracked, large number of R and D couldn't be performed, as a result of which the hospital was unable to contribute to Indian statistics to prevent HAI deaths & medical error or improving quality of healthcare.</p>
<p>He explored the possibility of developing a computer based hospital management solution. With this in mind he approached professionals in the software vertical and briefed them about his own understanding of the challenges of running a 24/7 healthcare organization and devising a solution.</p>
<p>In 2010, with his vision and an expert IT team by his side, the firstCloud based SaaS Applications DrMSaaS was launched in the Indian Healthcare industry. The application assisted in the micro management of a busy hospital environment, and monitored its day to day management in the absence of the owner/manager.It was lapped up by hospitals in several countries and also went on to win many awards& recognitions worldwide.</p> 
<p>Since its launch DrMSAAS/DrMHope has undergonemany improvisations; encompassingand streamlining various services & operations in thehealthcaresector. The current edition of DrMSaas can manage medical, financial, and management related aspects effectively. </p>
<p>This user-friendly, cost-effective, and a scalable cloud based solution used by health care organizations in countries like ......</p>
