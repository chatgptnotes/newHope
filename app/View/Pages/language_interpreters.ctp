<P>The <b>Health Care Interpreter Network </b>(HCIN) is collaborative of hospitals and providers that share the 
services of their trained <b>language interpreters</b> over a video and voice network. Its voice/video 
technology facilitates very rapid connection to qualified <b>medical interpreters </b>for 15 spoken languages. 
The vast majority of the HCIN interpreting is done in outpatient clinics rung by the county facilities or
 teaching hospitals.</p>
<h2>Two innovations under HCIN are as follows:</h2>
<p><ul>	
<li>Creative use of an existing technology to form a voice/video over IP (V/VoIP) network.</li>
<li>An organizational and governance structure that enables the network to overcome the
 barriers that frequently stifle innovations in county-operated health systems.</li></ul>
