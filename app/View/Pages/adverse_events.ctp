<h1 style="color:#0099FF">Adverse Events</h1>
<p>The DRMHOPE team built an <b>electronic reporting tool </b>which identifies adverse events occurring  
throughout their hospital based upon queries of their <b>electronic health record </b>(EHR) system, such as
 abnormal lab data or antidote medications prescribed in the event of a medical problem. This daily 
 report, termed the <b>Automated Adverse Event Detection</b> (AAED), is monitored by a nurse who analyzes
  each abnormal item to determine its level of harm and whether it was preventable. The appropriate 
  physician and managers then study the information to determine how they can improve their processes
   and avoid similar adverse events in the future. The review team may include the clinicians involved with 
   the event as well as "trigger-specific experts".
