	<p>
		<b>Cloud enabled App:</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	Traditional business applications have always been very complicated and
	expensive. The amount and variety of hardware and software required to
	run them are daunting. You need a whole team of experts to install,
	configure, test, run, secure, and update them.

		total project cost goes down considerably. With a cloud app, you just
		open a browser, log in, customize the app, and start using it.</p>

	<p>Cloud Implementation is a way to increase capacity or add
		capabilities on the Cloud without investing in new infrastructure,
		training new personnel, or licensing new software. Cloud
		Implementation uses the internet and central remote servers to
		maintain data and applications. Cloud Implementation encompasses any
		subscription-based or pay-per-use service, in real time over the
		Internet, extends IT's existing capabilities. So that any upgrades to
		the platform or the application it supports automatically for all

		<li>Detailed Technical Architecture:
			<p>
				DrMHope is a SaaS based <b>hospital information system</b>. It is
				designed to integrate the different informationsystems existing in
				these organizations into one single efficient system. DrMHope HMS
				solves the problemsinherent in a network of multiple programs that
				are noncompatible with each other. It can integrate almost anytype
				of services, systems, specilities, clinic, processes, data,
				communication, etc. that exist in a hospital. Itsdesign can even
				handle non-medical services or functions like security, maintenance,
				etc. It is modular andhighly scalable.
			</p>
			<p>It is a web based software and all its functions can be accessed
				with a common web browser thus there isno need for special user
				interface software. All program modules are processed on the server
				side. Moduleupdates and extensions do not require changes on the
				browsers thus there are no network interruptions and downtimes. Its
				design supports multiple server configurations to distribute traffic
				and improve speed and efficiency.
		
		<li>The system is built on Open Source Technologies:
			<p>All major components are free. eg. Apache webserver; PHP scripting
				engine; standard scripts; MySQL database; Internet/Intranet Browser;
				Installation, development and maintenance costs are low.</p>
		</li>
		<li>Uses a standard database language - MySQL. :
			<p>Solves the data incompatibility. Data can be sharedthroughout the
				whole network. External programs can also access the data by using
				the standard SQL languageto query information.</p>
		</li>
		<li>Uses the PHP and Javascript scripting languages:
			<p>Solves the platform dependency issue. Improvement and adaptation
				of existing program modules as well as creation of new program
				modules are easy and quick. Development costs and time sink
				substantially. The platform has built-in automation, data
				validation, signalling, and updating features. This
				substantiallyreduces the occurrence of erroneous data and also
				removes the burden of ounterchecking data manually.</p>
		</li>
		<li>All program modules are server side processed:
			<p>No downtime during module updates and extensions. The users would
				likely not notice the replacement of modules. All program modules
				and functions follow the same design philosophies and user
				navigation principles. The GUI design is consistent throughout the
				whole platform - This helps resolve the complexity of learning
				multiple programs. The user needs to learn only how to use DrMHope
				system. The training time is shorter and absence from actual
				workplace is shorter.</p>
		</li>
		<li>Program functions are accessed via standard browser:
			<p>No need for dedicated and costly client programs. Can be accessed
				via the internet since application uses standard internet protocols
				and Physicians or surgeons can access patients' data from outside
				the hospital without using specialized software.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Framework:</b>
	</p>

	<p>The platform uses PHP frameworks, CakePHP. It is a rapid development
		framework that provides an extensible architecture for developing,
		maintaining, and deploying mid and large sized applications. It is
		designed using MVC and ORM within the convention over configuration
		paradigm.</p>
	<p>
		<b>CakePHP USPs include:</b>
	
	
	<ul>
		<li>Application Scaffolding</li>
		<li>Code generation via Bake</li>
		<li>Helpers for HTML, Forms, Pagination, AJAX, JavaScript, XML, RSS
			and more</li>
		<li>Access Control Lists and Authentication</li>
		<li>Simple yet extensive validation of model data</li>
		<li>Router for mapping URL and extension handling</li>
		<li>Security, Session, and RequestHandler Components</li>
	</ul>
	</p>


	<p>
		<b>Multi-Tenant Model</b>
	</p>

	<p>DrMHope is Cloud based <b>Saas application for hospital management
		system</b> has multitenancy feature. DrMHope provides the ability to
		deliver software to multiple clients from single, shared instance
		which is the most significant requirement in recent times. The major
		advantages of multi-tenancy are in its cost-effectiveness. The ability
		to share hardware, software, application development, and maintenance
		cost amongst tenants in turn helps in significant reduction of cost.
		Apart from that, sharing a single instance of an application between
		tenants helps in migration initiatives as different tenants can be
		simultaneously upgraded.</p>

	<p>
		<b>Enhancing the efficiency level for Hope using Multi-tenancy:</b>
	</p>

	<p>The major leverage for efficiency comes from multi-tenancy, the ability to accommodate different users of the application. The Software-as-a-Service  model allows for Innovative pricing mechanisms, based on a subscription model, make paying for IT completely stress-free, easy adoption of technology reduces upfront investments and saves on the cost of maintenance and future upgrades.</p>
