<h2>We Think About Security...So You Don't Have To</h2>

<p>Patient privacy is crucial. However, keeping your records on local servers or paper files leaves you open to security exploits and data theft. Your data security is our number one priority, which is why we provide the most robust data infrastructure, virus protection, spam filtering and encryption measures available:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bank-level data system security</strong> Our world-class data centers feature biometric security, data back-ups, redundant power supplies and continuous surveillance systems. All your data transfers with us have the highest level of SSL/TLS bank-level encryption against malicious parties.</li>

<li><strong>Account security</strong> Access to your EHR account is defined by strict user access levels so you can be ensured that information doesn't fall into the wrong hands. A live activity feed in your EHR allows you to audit any action taken in your practice.</li>
</ul>
